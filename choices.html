<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<p>By conducting a thorough evaluation of the risks and opportunities associated with implementing artificial intelligence
   (AI) in education systems, we can make more defined choices that benefit both students and educators. One notable 
   opportunity is the quick and easy access to information that AI provides to students. This is particularly valuable 
   in education systems with limited human educators, allowing students to seek specific assistance and support. 
   Implementing this in a safe and ethical manner requires large datasets and unbiased algorithms to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Another beneficial implementation involves leveraging existing AI-based game platforms, such as Kahoot, to enhance 
  learning through interactive quizzes. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can offer immersive 
  learning experiences, catering to visual learners. Proper implementation is crucial to minimize distractions and keep 
  students focused on the subject matter.</p>

<p>For educators, an AI-powered written task assessor could be a valuable tool. According to bernardmarr.com, 
  these systems are making significant progress in assessing written responses. Such an implementation would free up 
  educators' time, allowing for more one-on-one interactions with students who may not rely solely on AI for tutoring.
   However, it is essential to ensure the reliability of the AI system, with educators reviewing and verifying the 
   assessments generated.</p>
