<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots have revolutionized education by offering numerous benefits to students and
   teachers. These intelligent systems provide an alternative and personalized learning experience, equipping students
    with additional resources and support. AI chatbots are particularly advantageous in situations with high student-to-teacher
     ratios, as they can efficiently deliver relevant information and address specific queries, alleviating the workload of
      educators. Moreover, these chatbots promote engagement and active participation, facilitating interactive 
      conversations tailored to individual needs.</p>

<p>Despite the remarkable advantages, the integration of AI chatbots in education necessitates careful consideration 
  of certain challenges. Maintaining academic integrity is of utmost importance, as there is a potential for misuse,
   such as plagiarism and cheating. Some chatbots can readily provide answers to assessments, undermining the learning 
   process and compromising students' educational journey. Striking a balance between leveraging AI for educational 
   enhancement and upholding academic standards is crucial. Educators and policymakers must engage in critical evaluation
    to harness the full potential of AI chatbots while ensuring a fair and ethical learning environment.</p>
